A delivery company IParcel delivers packages to certain locations every day. Below is a sample set of the lat and lngs. 
• 1 parcel per location for the sake of simplicity 
• There are n number of delivery boys riding motorcycles available

The purpose of this problem is to come up with an efficient path for each of the 25 drivers from a central distribution point (11.552931,104.933636).

Things we expect 
• Code on a git repo 
• Efficiency in running the problem 
• Any visualisation that you can think of 
• Ideas on how you plan to scale this if the number of locations increase (more warehouses and distribution points)
. Also how this can be translated to engineering infrastructure if need be. 
• Problem statement is purposefully at a very high level. 

If you have any new ideas we didn’t think of, would be a bonus.
